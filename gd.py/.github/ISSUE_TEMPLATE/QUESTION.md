Generally speaking support questions are better answered in our Discord server. The response rate is faster and many people are willing to help. If you **really** feel like the question belongs here then feel free to delete this text and continue on. **Please do not open issues about asking not gd.py-related questions, these will be most likely closed really quick.**

Our support server can be found here:

Official server: https://discord.gg/KtJkbut
